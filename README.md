# Orbital Maneuvers MATLAB scripts

This repository is a comprehensive collection of MATLAB scripts dedicated to simulating, analyzing, and visualizing **orbital maneuvers** in space flight mechanics. It focuses on both **in-plane** and **out-of-plane** transfers, with tools to compare their performance and analyze key trade-offs such as delta-V efficiency.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is:

- Understanding the fundamental mechanics of orbital maneuvers;
- Visualizing orbit changes using MATLAB 2D plots;
- Comparing multiple strategies;
- Learning how delta-V varies with different transfer types and orbital parameters.

This code is intended for educational and exploratory purposes and assumes idealized conditions (instantaneous burns, two-body dynamics).
